Developing with HTML5 README
============================

This presentation was used for the "Developing with HTML5" session at Google I/O
2010.  It was based off of the slide deck from http://code.google.com/p/html5-slides/ but all of the slides were rewritten
to show new HTML5 content.  You should have gotten this source from a branch
in that project's SVN repository.

To run the project, execute serve_appengine.sh from this directory.  You must
have dev_appserver.py (available from the App Engine SDK) on your path.  You
will be able to access your slides from http://localhost:5104.
